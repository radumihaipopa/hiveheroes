# Hive Heroes

Welcome to the Hive Heroes! This is a simple web-based game where you can interact with a bee swarm and try to hit different types of bees. The goal is to have fun and see how long you can keep the bees alive.

## Features

- Interact with the bee swarm by clicking the "Hit" button to deal damage to random bees.
- Different bee types have different health points and damage values, written on the bee card.
- Bee types are Queen, Workers, and Drones.
- If the Queen's health reaches zero, all bees in the swarm die.
- The game restarts after 3 seconds after game over.
- Game state is persisted between different browser sessions with local storage.

## Technologies Used

- React (UI components and user interaction)
- TypeScript (Type annotations and enhanced code quality)
- HTML5 & CSS3 (Styling and layout)
- Local Storage (For game state persistence)
